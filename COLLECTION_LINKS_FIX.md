# Collection Links Fix Summary

## Issue
The user guide links (and other collection links) were throwing 404 errors because they were using hardcoded URLs instead of Jekyll's collection system.

## Root Cause
1. Hardcoded URLs in `index.html` and collection pages didn't match Jekyll's collection permalink structure
2. The links weren't using Jekyll's collection system to dynamically generate URLs

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Index.html
- **Before**: Hardcoded links like `/user_guides/zeta_add_money_guide/`
- **After**: Dynamic collection loops using `{% for guide in site.user_guides %}`

### 2. Collection Pages (_pages/developer-guides.md, user-guides.md, knowledge-base.md)
- **Before**: Complex conditional logic with hardcoded URLs
- **After**: Simple loops through `site.developer_guides`, `site.user_guides`, `site.knowledge_base`

### 3. Benefits of New Approach
- ✅ **Automatic URL Generation**: Jekyll automatically generates correct URLs based on collection configuration
- ✅ **Dynamic Content**: New collection items automatically appear without code changes
- ✅ **No 404 Errors**: Uses Jekyll's built-in `guide.url` which is guaranteed to be correct
- ✅ **Front Matter Integration**: Automatically pulls title, description, and tags from collection files
- ✅ **Maintainable**: Less hardcoded content, easier to update

### 4. Technical Details
- Used `site.collection_name` to access collections
- Used `guide.url | relative_url` for proper URL generation
- Added tag display from front matter
- Maintained consistent styling and card layouts

## Testing
After these changes:
1. All collection items should have working links
2. URLs will be generated as `/user_guides/filename/` format
3. Adding new files to collections will automatically create working links
4. No more 404 errors for collection items

## Files Modified
- `index.html` - Fixed all three collection sections
- `_pages/developer-guides.md` - Replaced hardcoded cards with dynamic loop
- `_pages/user-guides.md` - Replaced hardcoded cards with dynamic loop  
- `_pages/knowledge-base.md` - Replaced hardcoded cards with dynamic loop

The links should now work correctly and automatically adapt to your collection structure!
