## Sunset Endpoint
The `GET /pet/findByTags` endpoint is deprecated and in the sunset phase.

This endpoint retrieves the pets based on the tags which affect the emotional state of the pet lovers. You can use the `GET /pet/findByStatus` to retrieve the pets based on the pet's availability which is an alternative to the `GET /pet/findByTags`. By using the `GET /pet/findByStatus`, the pet lovers emotional state is compromised.

**The sunset is scheduled on January 10, 2023.**

### Example

In this example, as a user, I would like to purchase a pet from the petstore.

#### Step 1: Create a pet in petstore

First, you must create a pet object with a category, tags, and status that needs to be added to the petstore.

Make a POST request with category, tags, and status.

This is the example of the POST request:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
'https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/pet' \
-H 'accept: application/json' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
"id": 8764,
"category": {
"id": 34623,
"name": "Kitten"
},
"name": "Garfield Dom",
"photoUrls": [
"photo"
],
"tags": [
{
"id": 97487,
"name": "cat"
}
],
"status": "available"
}'
```

Upon sending the request, the pet is created in the petstore.

This is the response for the POST request:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "",
  "data": {
    "id": 8764,
    "category": {
      "id": 34623,
      "name": "Kitten"
    },
    "name": "Garfield Dom",
    "photoUrls": [
      "photo"
    ],
    "tags": [
      {
        "id": 97487,
        "name": "cat"
      }
    ],
    "status": "available"
  }
}
```

#### Step 2: Add an image to the pet in your petstore

Secondly, add an image of the cat in the petstore. You can add the latest image of your cat.

Make a POST request to upload the image to the petstore.

This is the example POST request:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
'https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/pet/8764/uploadImage' \
-H 'accept: application/json' \
-H 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
-F 'additionalMetadata=This is the pic of the garfield dom.' \
-F 'file=@garfield.jpg;type=image/jpeg'
```

This is the response for the POST request:

```json
{
  "code": 200,
  "type": "unknown",
  "message": "additionalMetadata: This is the pic of the garfield dom.\nFile uploaded to ./garfield.jpg, 3338467 bytes"
}
```

#### Step 3: Create a purchase order for the pet

Finally, create a purchase order for the pet (8764: Garfield Dom) in the petstore.

Make a POST request to create a purchase order for the pet.

This is the example POST request:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
'https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/store/order' \
-H 'accept: application/json' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{
"id": 26543,
"petId": 8764,
"quantity": 5,
"shipDate": "2022-07-10T16:04:26.381Z",
"status": "placed",
"complete": true
}'
```

This is the response for the POST request:

```json
{
  "id": 26543,
  "petId": 8764,
  "quantity": 5,
  "shipDate": "2022-07-10T16:04:26.381+0000",
  "status": "placed",
  "complete": true
}
```

#### Step 4: Delete a purchase order

This is an optional step. If you have placed an inappropriate purchase order, you can delete it and place a new purchase order.

Make a DELETE request with the order ID: 26543.

```bash
curl -X 'DELETE' \
'https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/store/order/26543' \
-H 'accept: application/json'
```

This is the response for the DELETE request:

```json
{
  "code": 200,
  "type": "unknown",
  "message": "26543"
}
```
