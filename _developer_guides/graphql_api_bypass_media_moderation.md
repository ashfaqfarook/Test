## About Bypass Media Moderation

The bypass media moderation permission empowers members to share visual and multimedia content, including images, videos, and attachments, instantaneously. This feature circumvents the potential delays that would typically arise from a moderation review process, providing an efficient member experience where timely content sharing is essential.

You can set this permission at the following levels:

- Community
- Category
- Forum
- Blog
- KB
- Occasion (Event)
- Group
- Idea

> **Note:** Only Admins and Moderators can set this permission for your community.

## Query to Fetch the Permission

You can use the below query to view your community bypass media moderation permission.

```graphql
{
  permissionsForCoreNode(id: "community:DocsCommunity") {
    ... on CommunityPermissions {
      bypassMediaModeration {
        access
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**GraphQL Response:**

```json
{
  "data": {
    "permissionsForCoreNode": {
      "bypassMediaModeration": {
        "access": "DENIED"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

      bypassMediaModeration: {
        access: GRANTED
